**Introduction**
A marketplace where people can sell / giveaway recycled items for free or for a price. The
seller can easily sell their recycled items compared to just throwing them away and the
buyers can benefit from a platform that specializes in recycled items. The sellers could be
people that are too lazy to recycle, and the buyers could consist of people looking for
recycled items such as NGOs, recycling centers, nature clubs from universities / schools
and people who are just enthusiastic in recycling lowering the barrier of entry for people
to start recycling
**Marketplace**
In this section , you can do sales and buy activities. If you are looking for something to buy,
you can just click on the selection options. For now , we have 3 options which are glass,
paper and plastic. You may select multiple options and our ReEarth app will filter that out
for you. To build this, we use ListView.Builder to generate our search listing result.
**Sale listing**
The sale listing section helps you to sell your recyclable items. You can upload the images
here from your own phone gallery. This section is quite simple and keeps things packed.
Just fill in a few details about your items and they are ready to be published. Now your
items will be displayed in the marketplace section.

**Eco Assistant**
Introducing you to our chatbot assistant. Our chatbot will guide you on how to recycle your
items. For this to happen, we connect the Gemini API to our app system. . You may select
multiple options at the same time and our chatbot will display all the results for the items
you requested.
